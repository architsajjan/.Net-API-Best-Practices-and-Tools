# REST API Optimization in .NET

## Overview

This repository demonstrates tools and techniques to optimize REST API calls in .NET applications. It covers the usage of **HttpClient**, **HttpClientFactory**, **RestSharp**, and **Refit**, along with best practices for improving API performance, maintainability, and scalability.

## Key Features

- **HttpClient**: Fine-grained control for handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **HttpClientFactory**: Centralized management of HttpClient instances to address connection issues.
- **RestSharp**: Simplified, readable syntax for handling RESTful operations.
- **Refit**: Type-safe, declarative approach to building REST API clients.

## Code Demonstrations

This repository includes:

- Example implementations for all four tools.
- Scenarios addressing common challenges like socket exhaustion, fault tolerance, and scaling.
- Comparisons of memory usage, performance, and ideal use cases.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET Core SDK 6.0 or later
- Visual Studio 2022 or any compatible IDE

### Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/RepoName.git
cd RepoName
```

Restore dependencies and build the project:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

### Running the Demos

Run the application to view the demonstrations:

```bash
dotnet run
```

Access the Swagger UI (if configured) at `http://localhost:5000/swagger` for interactive API testing.

## Tools and Libraries

### HttpClient

- Provides low-level control over HTTP requests and responses.
- Can lead to issues like socket exhaustion if not managed properly.

### HttpClientFactory

- Solves connection management issues with centralized client lifecycle handling.
- Integrates seamlessly with Dependency Injection.

### RestSharp

- A lightweight, third-party library for simplified REST API interactions.
- Ideal for CRUD operations and applications requiring inbuilt serialization.

### Refit

- Allows declarative API client generation using interfaces and attributes.
- Offers enhanced readability and easier testing for type-safe REST calls.

## Performance Insights

- **Memory Efficiency**: HttpClient > Refit > RestSharp.
- **Response Time**: HttpClient and RestSharp are comparable, followed by Refit and HttpClientFactory.
- Use the right tool based on project requirements and API complexity.
